\section{Abstract}
The TU Vienna space team needs a test station to check the reliability of the CubeSat. For this purpose, a chamber is to be built in which various tests can be carried out with the satellite. The chamber should be able to operate at a temperature of 0°C to 30°C. There are various sensors in the chamber to make a comparison between the sensors on the CubeSat and in the test station. Through this actual-target comparison, errors on the CubeSat can be identified and faulty components can be replaced. In order to illustrate this actual-target comparison and to control all components, a user-friendly web application should be developed. Using a gyroscope, the CubeSat is rotated in the x, y and z directions. The sensors on the satellite can be used to record the effects of this rotation and display them using the web application.
